## How to contribute
**Rule #0:** make small and frequent updates. Every commits and pushes should contain small changes instead of big changes!

**Rule #0.1** remember the *Rule #0*!

**Rule #1:** all documentation must be in *Markdown* format. Because it is easy to view and edit online!

**Rule #2:** all presentations should be in *pdf* format;

**Rule #3:** don't push to the master branch. Push to only your branch.

**Rule #4:** (1) find bug? Create an issue and label it as *bug*. (2) need some feature? Create an issue and label it *enhancement*. (3) have idea? Create an issue!
