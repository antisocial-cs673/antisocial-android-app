#Quality Assurance
Quality Assurance Document
Performance:
1. The APP can work fluently about the basic function 
2. Has log in account 
3. Has several modes
4. Can share through facebook or twitter
5. Can count down time accurately
Battery Life:
Too long time focus on study or work is also not good, so 8 hours social APP block will be enough
UI Design:
1. Consistency
  a). Construct has an uniform style
  b). The style should be consistent with product content
2. Be clear
  Easy to understand visually
3. Users’ familiarity degree
  Users can use the interface use their previous knowledge, UI design shouldn’t out of common sense
Thinking from clients’ side
   Users always use and understand by their own way. We should think what users’ think, make what users do
Make interface in order
   Use tables, listings to make APP clear. A neat interface can let users use more easily
Security
   Users can make their own choice, all the choices should be reversible. If user make a dangerous choice, system should alert users
Simplicity
   Make our APP easy- use, easy to let people know about it and decrease the probability of users’ mis-operation
Hommization
   High efficiency and users’ satisfaction are both about hommization. Users can design their own interface and can save it.
About response time
   Long time waiting in a same interface will make users crazy. If an action can response in 3-5sec, no need another interface. If an action need to response over 5 sec, there should be a progress bar to tell users the APｐ　ｉｓ　ｓｔｉｌｌ　ｒｕｎｎｉｎｇ
   
Coding Standard:
1. No redundant code
2. Use the clearest algorithm
